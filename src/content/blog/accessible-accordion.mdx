## Overview

My explorations into building an accessible accordion. First in HTML & Vanilla ES6, then again in React.

> Disclaimer: The internet is full of wonderful articles on accessible accordions. This post does not attempt to reinvent the wheel. It is my personal exploration of what is required to make the key components of the web inclusive and accessible. 

## My accessibility checklist

This list was created based on the published advice of accessibility experts and standards groups.  I do not pretend to have met all user cases, and my testing is me, with a mac screen reader.  

**This is not, and is not intended to act as, a replacement for diverse user testing.**

## Basic Mark-up 

```
 <div class="accordion__title">
    <h2>
    <button aria-expanded="false" type="button">
     Title 
     <svg focusable="false" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 10 10">
          <rect height="8" width="2" y="1" x="4" class="vert" />
          <rect height="2" width="8" y="4" x="1" />
        </svg>
</button></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion__content" hidden>
    <p>Content</p>
  </div>
```

## How & Why? 

 <Accordion>
        <div title="Signalling functionality for keyboard users #1">
          <h4>Feature:</h4>
          <p>Title contains a button nested in an h2 element.</p>
          <h4>Rationale:</h4>
          <p>
            Using a button element affords us the default interactivity - it is
            focusable, and it has default keybindings (activation on space or
            enter). Nested the button within the heading results in (most)
            screen readers announcing the heading text alongside the button.
            This aids comprehension.
          </p>
          <h4>Implementation details:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To fulfil the requirement for the accordion to look good, the
              button adopts the styling of its parent element.
            </li>
            <li>
              The button is not given the role="button" , as this is defined by
              the W3C as implicit semantics, and should not be used.
            </li>
            <li>
              The button is given type="button" to ensure that if the accordion
              was within a form element, the default button submission behaviour
              would not be activated.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
  <div title="Signalling functionality for keyboard users #2">
          <h4>Feature:</h4>
          <p>
            Button has an aria-expanded attribute, content has a hidden
            attribute.
          </p>
          <h4>Rationale:</h4>
          <p>
            The aria-expanded tells screen reader users that there is optional
            content to be viewed, if they chose to interact with this element.
            The hidden attribute prevents screen readers reading out content
            that has not actively been selected.
          </p>
          <h4>Implementation details:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To support older browsers, the hidden attribute is supplemented by
              `display:none` in the CSS
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div title="Signalling functionality to sighted users #1">
          <h4>Feature:</h4>
          <p>
            The button contains a nested SVG "plus" icon. This icon transitions
            to a "minus" icon when the accordion section is expanded
          </p>
          <h4>Rationale:</h4>
          <p>
            he icon allows functionality to be signalled to sighted users,
            without using colour alone. Functionality is already being signalled
            to screen reader users, and as such there is no requirement to label
            this icon.
          </p>
          <h4>Implementation details:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Direction can change based on localisation (typical accordion
              chevrons point right when closed, down when expanded). Using plus
              and minus icons may be a more reliable and translatable
              representation of the state change occurring here. There is an
              established pattern of plus and minus icons representing accordion
              behaviour. This would, of course, require testing with your
              particular users.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div title="Signalling functionality to sighted users #2">
          <h4>Feature:</h4>
          <p>Applying an SVG focus style</p>
          <h4>Rationale:</h4>
          <p>
            The button is set to inherit all styles from its parent - this
            ensures the button doesn't break the visual consistency of the
            layout, but it also removes the focus styles. Adding these on to the
            SVG ensures it is clear to a user tabbing through the interface,
            without screen reader guidance, that the element can be interacted
            with.
          </p>
          <h4>Implementation details:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A high colour contrast box shadow was added - this ensures the
              focus is not missed, and will wrap any border-radius properties on
              an element (this is missing from the outline property).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        </Accordion>
