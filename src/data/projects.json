    "overview": "<p>Working in web development, I am continually struck by how much of the web is built on a handful of key components.</p><p> Beneath every beautiful designed site or application lies the building blocks of the web - file inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, accordions, and more.</p><p>I wanted to take a step back and ensure I really understood the accessibility implications of these unsung heroes.</p><p>This project is my opportunity to solidify best accessibility practice, as I build a collection of components - first in HTML & Vanilla JS, then again in React.",
    "ux": "<p>The components were developed in isolation, without a specific user-group in mind. Depending on the use-case, the user needs for the design or interactivity are likely to vary. The key considerations here were to create a solid, accessible baseline from which the components could be adapted and evolved as required.</p><p>Consequently, the design and styled adopted were based on colour palettes I found in daily life which appealed to me or matched particular projects I was working on, and which met colour contrast requirements.</p>",

This list was adapted from the published advice of accessibility experts and standards groups.

The club offers Japanese students the opportunity to practice their conversation skills, in-person, with native speakers.

The club also offers paid 'bootcamps' - intensive weekend courses, providing complete Japanese-language immersion. </p>",

Talking to users made it clear that the online presence simply acted as a digital signpost for the club - the allure of Nihongo Scotland is the opportunity to converse in-person with native speakers. </p><p>User Interview Results:</p><ul><li>Copy should be kept to a reading level suitable for non-native English speakers</li><li>The website should act as a brochure site, providing club time, location, and information. There is no current need to provide an online equivalent of the offline experience.</li><li>Bootcamp content is important - a large number of members found the page via their interest in / attendance at the Bootcamps</li></ul>",
