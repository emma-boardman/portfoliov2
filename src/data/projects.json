    "overview": "<p>Working in web development, I am continually struck by how much of the web is built on a handful of key components.</p><p> Beneath every beautiful designed site or application lies the building blocks of the web - file inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, accordions, and more.</p><p>I wanted to take a step back and ensure I really understood the accessibility implications of these unsung heroes.</p><p>This project is my opportunity to solidify best accessibility practice, as I build a collection of components - first in HTML & Vanilla JS, then again in React.",
    "ux": "<p>The components were developed in isolation, without a specific user-group in mind. The objective was to create a solid, accessible baseline from which the components could be adapted and evolved as required.</p><p>Consequently, the colours adopted were either related to other personal projects, or arbitrarily chosen. The colour combinations selected all meet the WCAG Level AAA contrast ratio.</p>",

This list was adapted from the published advice of accessibility experts and standards groups.</p><p> I do not pretend to have met all user cases, and the initial testing was conducted by myself, using built-in Android, Mac, and iOS, and Windows accessibility tooling.</p><p><strong>This is not, and is not intended to act as, a replacement for diverse user testing.</strong></p>",

    "overview": "<p>Nihongo Scotland is a Japanese language club in Edinburgh, Scotland. The club offers Japanese students the opportunity to practice their conversation skills, in-person, with native speakers.</p><p>The primary offering, 'Friday Night Study Club', is a casual, drop-in, donation-based session. The club also offers paid 'bootcamps' - intensive weekend courses, providing complete Japanese-language immersion. </p><p>The goal of this project was a holistic overhaul their online presence, beginning with branding, content strategy, and the Nihongo Scotland website.</p>",
    "ux": "<p>User Research began with 1:1 semi-structured interviews with club members.</p><p>Talking to members, new and old, made it clear that the website was simply the digital signpost for the club - the allure of Nihongo Scotland is the opportunity to converse in-person with native speakers, and the community. The club filled an offline niche that online learning resources couldn't match. The website didn't need bells and whistles, or elaborate interactivity - it simply needed to convey the key information for the physical meets. </p><p>Design guidelines determined by User Interviews:</p><ul><li>Copy must be kept to a reading grade suitable for non-native English speakers</li><li>The website will be a brochure site, providing club time, location, and information. There is no current need to provide an online equivalent of the offline experience.</li><li>Bootcamp content is important - a large number of members found the page via their interest in / attendance at the Bootcamps</li></ul>",

A full set of metrics will be run on the respective MVPs to serve as a baseline for the comparison. The metrics will then be rerun once both applications have been extended.</p><p>The application built was intended for use as a Project Management (PM) tool for a web development agency, who do not feel their use cases are met by existing PM tools.</p> ",
